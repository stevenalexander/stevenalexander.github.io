<p>Steven Alexander is a software engineer from Northern Ireland. He mainly writes incredibly boring technical posts which interest no one, mainly because he has the memory of a goldfish so blogs stuff he doesn't want to forget himself. He's basically ruining the internet for everyone. Sorry.</p>
<p>Follow him on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/evilnevets">@evilnevets</a>.</p>
