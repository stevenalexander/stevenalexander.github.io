<p>If you've been trying to start a Unicorn app and seeing something like the following error:</p>
<p>"'raise_if_conflicts': can't activate rack-1.4.1, already activated rack-1.5"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's down the versions of rack gem which you installed. In your applications gemfile you should specify the version of rack you want to use, e.g.</p>
<p>gem "rack", "1.4.1"</p>
<p>Run "bundle update rack" and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>If not, run "gem uninstall rack", you may see that you have two versions of rack installed, uninstall the wrong one and try again.</p>
