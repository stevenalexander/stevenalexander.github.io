I read an article ["Please, everyone, put your entire development environment in Github"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/put-your-dev-env-in-github/) which I liked. Containerising development and testing environments for consistency has been an aim for me and hearing about [a VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that allows you to easily do this is a dream come true.

The first thing I've tried it out on is this blog, a Ruby Jekyll site, as it's the only thing I use Ruby for and it irritates me to have to install Ruby just for it. The source is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/stevenalexander/stevenalexander.github.io), instructions in the readme.md.
