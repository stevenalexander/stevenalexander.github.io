<p>Not specifically ASP.MVC related, but I used JQuery because of it so I'm grouping it in anyway.</p>
<p>Created for a screen which needed to hide/show controls based on a radio button list selection, something which I've done before but the simplicity of how to implement it with JQuery impressed me so I'm blogging it.</p>
<p>It uses two bits of standard JQuery functionality, selecting elements based on class and applying css styles to the selection of elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decorate the elements to hide/show with css classes which will control when they are displayed, table rows in this example:</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Capture" height="137" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/capture-scaled500.png?w=300" width="374" /></div></p>
<ul>
<li>Then create a Javascript function which will use the JQuery class selector to find those elements and set the css to hide/show, this function will be called when the document is loaded to setup the page based on the selected radio button value.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://stevenwilliamalexander.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/capture-scaled1000.png"><img alt="Capture" height="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/capture-scaled1000.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div>
<p>Simple! Doing it using plain JS would have been much longer and harder to maintain (changing the elements to display just requires modifying the classes).</p>
