<p>Got this mysterious error when trying to build a scala play solution containing multiple projects (common projects which the play projects had dependencies on):</p>
<pre>[error] {file:/mnt/jenkins/workspace/myproj/}mysubproj/compile:sources: java.util.NoSuchElementException: Either.left.value on Right</pre>
<p>Turned out the problem was I hadn't specified the scala version for the common projects, so they were being built with scala 2.9.2 while the play projects tried to build with 2.9.1, causing the issue.</p>
<p>Fixed it by specifying the scala version for all projects in my Build.scala:</p>
<pre>scalaVersion := "2.9.1"</pre>
