Second day of the conference finished it off with some good talks around AI ethics, machine learning and new technologies.

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) and [Kubeflow Pipelines ](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview/)got a few talks, it seems like an interesting way to develop and productionise a machine learning solution.
