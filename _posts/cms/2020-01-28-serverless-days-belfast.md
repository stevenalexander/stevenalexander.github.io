On Friday I attended the first [Serverless days Belfast](http://belfast.serverlessdays.io/) conference. The event was great, a range of quality talks about Serverless technology all from different angles and areas. From new features in AWS/Azure, organisational transformation, how it breaks down barriers for entry, best practises, mistakes to avoid and new ways to think about design. It's a good conference that manages to keep you in one track and room for a day but you aren't bored.

Couple of random things I picked up:

* Romba have a x100 spike in requests on Christmas day
* I should listen to [Serverless Chats podcast](https://www.serverlesschats.com/) and follow Jeremy Daly
* Difference in Serverless and Managed Service is not needing to think about capacity management (e.g. your AWS managed Redis is not Serverless)
* Organisations are using Serverless now all over the place, it's not fringe now
* How it lowers the technical and operational barriers to production level deployments is a big deal (Farrah Campbells talk)
* Think about your code as a liability (code as technical debt)
* Machines are getting better at "talking in human", this will change how we interact with services (e.g. ML chat agents), "Treat users as Pets not Cattle"
* I should look at DDD and think about how to approach design in this new world

Lots of the speakers have uploaded their slides to Twitter [@BFSServerless](https://twitter.com/BFSServerless) and the talks were recorded, so check the [site](http://belfast.serverlessdays.io/) to see if they are available.
