On Friday I attended the first Serverless days Belfast conference. The event was great, a range of quality talks about Serverless technology all from different angles and areas. From new features in AWS/Azure, organisational transformation, how it breaks down barriers for entry, best practises, mistakes to avoid and new ways to think about design. It's a good conference that manages to keep you in one track and room for a day but you aren't bored.
